  .intro
    p The Ohio flag is unlike any other U.S. flag due to its unique shape. It’s the only flag that isn’t a rectangle and is instead a swallow-tailed burgee.
    p It was designed by Cleveland architect John Eisenmann in 1901 for the Pan-American Exposition in New York, created to fly over the Ohio Building.
    p The flag was officially adopted May 9, 1902.
