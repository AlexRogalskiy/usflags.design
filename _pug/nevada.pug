  .intro
    p Nevada has flown four state flags, with a notable third version resulting from a mistake in legislature that went unnoticed for 60 years.
    p The flag was designed in 1926 by Reno museum curator, Louis Shellback III. His flag was the winning entry in a design contest sponsored by Lt. Governor Maurice J. Sullivan.
    p It was adopted in 1929, but the inscription of the word “Nevada” (with letters placed between the points of the star) was incorrectly described. It was noticed and updated years later and “Nevada” was moved below the star where it was originally intended.
    p The corrected version of the flag was approved by the governor June 8, 1991, and finally implemented in October of the same year.

      h2 Flag design
      p The Nevada flag features a field of cobalt blue. In the canton is a variant of the state’s emblem which centers a silver five-pointed star.
      p Above the star is a gold banner with “Battle Born” inscribed in black. Below the star “Nevada” is inscribed also in gold and it is surrounded by two sprays of green sagebrush with gold flowers.
