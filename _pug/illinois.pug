  .intro
    p The original Illinois flag was adopted in 1915, designed by Lucy Derwent and submitted to a design contest held by the Daughters of the American Revolution.
    p The flag featured elements from the state seal, but was not widely recognized. So Chief Petty Officer Bruce McDaniel of Waverly petitioned to have “Illinois” added to the flag.
    p Redesigned by Sanford Hutchinson of Greenfield, the new flag replicated the state seal and added the state name below.
    p This version was officially adopted July 1, 1970.

      p The Illinois coat of arms reflects the design of the state seal.
      p Two seals preceded the current one, with 1819 and 1839 versions very closely resembling the Great Seal of the United States.
      p In 1867, despite not gaining approval to change the state motto, Tyndale began his redesign of the state seal resulting in the version we know today.
