  .intro
    p South Dakota’s first state flag was designed by Ida Anding McNeil, a local stenographer. It was adopted July 1, 1909 and featured a two-sided design: a golden sun on the obverse and the state seal on the reverse.
    p Proving difficult to manufacture, the flag was redesigned in 1963. The seal was moved to the obverse and placed on top of the sun.
    p The flag was updated one more time, when the nickname inscribed was changed from “The Sunshine State” to “The Mount Rushmore State.”
    p This version of the flag was officially adopted July 1, 1992.

      h2 Production
      p The South Dakota flag uses a proportion of 3:5.
      p Within the field, the seal should be 4/9 the width of the hoist and the sun, 5/9. The width each of the golden letters should be 1/18 the width of the hoist.
      p If resized, it must maintain these proportions.
      p Flags made for indoor use should have three sides of golden fringe 1/18 the width of the hoist.
