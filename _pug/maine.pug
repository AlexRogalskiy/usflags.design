  .intro
    p The Maine state flag follows a common pattern for U.S. state flags, featuring the coat of arms on a field of blue.
    p It wasn’t always this way, though. The first official flag was a simple and graphic design featuring a pine tree. It has proven very popular over the years and many campaigns have tried to revert the flag back to the original design with no success (yet).
    p The current version of the flag was adopted February 23, 1909.

      h2 Coat of Arms
      p The Maine coat of arms (and state seal) have remained relatively unchanged since adoption in 1820. It was formally standardized in 1919 to reduce small variations.

      h2 Colors
      p There are no official colors for the state coat of arms, so the flag in production sees a lot of variance. Statute does specify the field of blue to match the blue of the U.S. flag.

      h2 Production
      p Maine statute specifies the dimensino of the flag in feet and inches.
      p The flag should have a fly of 5 feet, 6 inches and a hoist of 4 feet, 4 inches.
      p If resized, it must maintain these proportions.
      p The coat of arms should be embroidered on a flag of silk and can be trimmed with knotted yellow fringe measuring 2 1/2 inches wide.
      h2 Pike
      p The flag should be flown on a 9 foot pike (flagple) with a tassled cord 8 feet 6 inches in length attached to the spearhead. The cord should be made of white and blue silk strands.

      h2 Previous iteration
      p The 1901 version of the Maine flag featured a green pine tree and a blue five-pointed star on a field of buff.
      p Two attempts in the 1990’s failed to bring back the original flag. In the last few years, though, private companies have begun manufacturing and selling a similar version resulting in increased popularity and new calls to change the flag once again.
