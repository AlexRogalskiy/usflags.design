  .intro
    p While Texas has had a variety of flags flown (like the familiar “Six Flags Over Texas”), it has only had one official state flag.
    p The flag was designed and adopted as the third official flag of the Republic of Texas. Though the original designer is unknown, it was officially drawn by Peter Krag and approved by President Mirabeau B. Lamar on January 25, 1839.
    p When Texas joined the U.S. in 1845 it kept its Lone Star Flag which has flown ever since. Texas was, however, #[em technically] flagless from 1879 to 1933 after state civil statues were revised and the flag code not renewed.
    p The flag was officially re-adopted August 31, 1933.

      h2 Iconography
      p The lone star on the flag represents Texas as the Lone Star State, established as a symbol years before when Texas gained independence from Mexico.
      p Texas statute says the flag “represents ALL of Texas and stands for our unity as one for God, State, and Country.”
      p Some attribute (unofficial) meaning to the star’s five points, which dates back to a 1948 issue of #[em Frontier Times] that claimed the star represents characteristics of a good Texan: loyalty, prudence, fortitude, broadmindedness, and righteousness.

      h2 Construction
      p The Texas flag should have a proportion of 2:3.
      p The blue vertical stripe is 1/3 the width of the fly, with the white star at its center measuring 3/4 the width of the stripe.
      h2 Pike
      p Texas law specifies the height of the pike (flagpole) to be 2.5 times as long as the flag’s hoist, with an optional finial of a star or spearhead.
      p If the flag is permanantly mounted, the flag may be decorated with gold fringe and the pike may have a gold cord or tassles.
