  .intro
    p The flag of Nebraska follows a common pattern for U.S. state flags, featuring the state seal on a field of blue.
    p Nebraska was the last of the 48 contiguous states to adopt a flag and in 1925 its “banner” was adopted officially.
    p Despite a few attempts to update the state seal and the flag, it has remained unchanged since.
    p It did receive an upgrade to the status of “flag” from “banner” on July 16, 1963.

      p The coat of arms and state seal were established in 1867 when Nebraska gained statehood.
      p In 1921, a bill was introduced to redesign the seal. Bertram Goodhue (the architect of the Nebraska State Capitol) designed the seal and the bill overwhelmingly passed the Nebraska House. It was opposed in the senate though and has remained unchanged.
