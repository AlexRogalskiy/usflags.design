  .intro
    p North Dakota’s flag was introduced in a 1911 bill by Colonel John H. Fraine.
    p Fraine led the North Dakota infantry during the Philippine–American War, where a similar flag (the U.S. coat of arms on a field of blue) was flown.
    p To make identifying the flag easier, “North Dakota” was added on a scroll of red and gold.
    p The flag was officially adopted March 3, 1911.

      h2 Flag design
      p The North Dakota flag features a field of blue charged with a left-facing eagle, centered.
      p Upon the eagle’s chest is a shield with seven red and six white alternating stripes. The eagle clasps an olive branch and a sheaf of arrows. In its mouth, it holds a banner inscribed with “E Pluribus Unum.”
      p Above the eagle are thirteen gold stars underneath golden sun rays.
      p Below the eagle, “North Dakota” is inscribed on a scroll of red and gold.
