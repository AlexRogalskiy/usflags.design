  .intro
    p Alaska became a territory of the United States in 1912. In its journey to statehood, the Alaska Department of the American Legion held a 1927 flag design contest for children across Alaska, grades 7-12.
    p The chosen flag was designed by 13-year-old Benny Benson who lived at Jesse Lee Mission Home in Seward, a home for displaced children. He received a scholarship and a gold watch and became a hero and inspiration to Alaskans.
    p Alaska’s state song #[em Alaska’s Flag] was written as a poem by Marie Drake and later composed by Elinor Dusenbury. The women were inspired by Benny’s story and design.
    p Benny’s flag was officially adopted May 2, 1927 and it remained when Alaska gained statehood in 1959.
