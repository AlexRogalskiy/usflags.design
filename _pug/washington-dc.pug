  .intro
    p In 1924, the Daughters of the American Revolution introduced a bill to establish a District Flag Commission to create and select a flag.
    p That year, artist Charles A. R. Dunn submitted a design based on the Washington family coat of arms. It took 14 years (and many other design options) before this flag was officially adopted October 15, 1938.
    p Because of this delay, the flag’s design was for years attributed to Melvin C. Hazen and Arthur E. Du Bois who both sat on the Commission.
    p It wasn’t until 1957 that Dunn published an article titled #[em The Origins of the District of Columbia Flag] and reclaimed his place within the flag’s history.

      h2 Iconography
      p The current design of the Washington family coat of arms dates back to 14th century England.
      p When Charles Dunn began his design, he took inspiration from Maryland and their flag, featuring the coats of arms from the Calvert and Crossland families.
      p Choosing George Washington’s family coat of arms seemed fitting.

      h2 Production
      p The D.C. flag is usually produced with a 1:2 proportion, but statute only specifies proportion of the visual elements relative to the hoist.
      p The chief (top white stripe) should be 3/10 the width of the hoist with each star measuring 2/10 the hoist and spaced evenly within the chief.
      p The red stripes and the base (bottom white stripe) should be 2/10 the hoist and the space between the red stripes should be 1/10.
