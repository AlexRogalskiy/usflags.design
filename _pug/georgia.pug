  .intro
    p Georgia holds a few flag records. Not only has it had the most flags (eight different iterations), its current flag is the most recently adopted of the entire nation’s.
    p The flag has created controversy for the state. The 1956 version featured the Confederate battle flag, adopted soon after Brown v. Board of Education ruled segregation unconstitutional.
    p The current flag, based on the first Confederate national flag (“Stars and Bars”) was officially adopted May 8, 2003.
    p The people of Georgia voted to keep this version of the flag in a referendum on March 2, 2004.

      p The Georgia flag features three horizontal bars of red, white, and red. In the upper left corner is a square canton of blue on which a ring of 13 white stars is placed, surrounding the state’s coat of arms in gold. Below the coat of arms, the words “In God We Trust” are inscribed.
