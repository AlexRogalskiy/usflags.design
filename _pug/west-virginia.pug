  .intro
    p After the Civil War began and Virginia joined the Confederacy, 39 of its western counties voted to stay and West Virginia gained statehood in 1863.
    p It has flown three different flags since, each one representing a kind of “trial and error” approach to flag design. With each iteration, mistakes were fixed and then fixed again.
    p The two previous versions were among the rare flags with a different design on their reverse.
    p The current version of the flag was adopted (and has been unchanged since) March 7, 1929.

      p At the center the state coat of arms is charged, surrounded by a wreath of rhododendron.
      p Above the coat of arms and on a red banner the words “State of West Virginia” are inscribed.
