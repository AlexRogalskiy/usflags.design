  .intro
    p Oregon has a unique state flag despite it featuring its coat of arms on a field of blue (like many others). Since Massachusetts updated its flag in 1971, Oregon is the only state with a different design on its reverse.
    p The state has only flown this one flag, though newspapers and legislators have tried to gain momentum for a redesign.
    p The flag was officially adopted relatively late on April 15, 1925.

      h2 Coat of Arms
      p Oregon has had a few versions of its seal and coat of arms. Previous iterations featured a salmon, Native American man, and the state motto “Alis Volat Propriis” which translates to “She flies with her own wings.”
      p This version was first designed in 1857 and adopted in 1859 when Oregon became a state.

      h2 Construction
      p Oregon statute does not include dimensions for the flag and there are conflicting records.
      p According to William Hill’s #[em The codes and general laws of Oregon] from 1892, the flag should have a hoist of 6 feet and a fly of 6 feet, 6 inches.
      p A 1959 letter to Lt. Colonel James S. Cook from State Librarian Eloise Ebert cites that Oregon law specifies a hoist of 4 feet, 4 inches and a fly of 5 feet, 6 inches.
      p Despite this, the first state flag was produced with a 2:3 proportion at 4 feet by 6 feet, and the flag is still commonly produced with these dimensions.
