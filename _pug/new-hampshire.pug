  .intro
    p The flag of New Hampshire follows a common pattern for U.S. state flags, featuring the state seal on a field of blue. It is the only flag, though, to feature a warship.
    p It was originally adopted February 24, 1909 and has changed just once to accommodate changes to the state seal.
    p The current version was officially adopted in 1931.

      h2 Previous iteration
      p The original New Hampshire flag still featured the state seal at its center. The ship was depicted further in the background, with ship builders working in the foreground. The law was not specific, so varying versions of the ship became common until 1931 when it was standardized.
      p The original seal featured the Latin words (later translated to English) “Sigillum Reipublicae Neo Hantoniensis” and the date 1784, when New Hampshire’s state constitution took effect.
      p The state coat of arms (pictured) shows a similar compositon to the original seal.
