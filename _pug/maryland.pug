  .intro
    p The design of the Maryland flag is based on English heraldry. The first Lord Baltimore, George Calvert, initiated the settlement of Maryland colony and lends the Calvert family crest and the crest of his mother’s family, the Crosslands.
    p The flag has historical significance, with each of the crests becoming symbols of Union (Calvert) and Confederate (Crossland) support during the Civil War. The two crests finally joined on the flag became a symbol of healing.
    p The flag was officially adopted March 9, 1904.

      p The Maryland flag features a quadrisection pattern.
      p The 1st and 4th quarter are a paly of gold and black (an even number of vertical stripes) and a bend dexter (right diagonal band) upon which the colors are reversed.
      p The 2nd and 3rd quarters are quadrisections of red and white with a cross bottony (a Greek cross with ends of trefoils) upon which the colors are reversed.

      h2 Construction
      p The flag should have a proportion of 2:3, divided into four equal quadrants.
      p The diagonal band in each Calvert quadrant should be centered at the corners.
      h2 Pike
      p Maryland law requires any pike (flagple) flying the state flag to be ornamented with a gold cross bottony. Government buildings adhere, but many private citizens and businesses choose not to.
