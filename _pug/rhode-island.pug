  .intro
    p The flag of Rhode Island strays from the average in two ways. It is almost square in shape, compared to the common 2:3 flag proportion, and it uses a low-contrast gold on white instead of a more typical light on dark color scheme.
    p The original version of the flag was adopted in 1877, but has had two redesigns since.
    p The current flag was officially adopted November 1, 1897.
