      strong: em Update coming soon.
    p Mississippi currently does not have a state flag.
    p Its controversial flag (and its second officially) was removed in June 2020 following nationwide Black Lives Matter protests.
    p Since Georgia changed its flag in 2003, Mississippi was the only U.S. flag to feature the Confederate battle flag, often called “The Southern Cross.”
    p This version of the flag was adopted February 7, 1894, almost 30 years after the end of the American Civil War.
    p The people of Mississippi previously voted (with a significant majority) to keep this version of the flag in a referendum on April 17, 2001.
    p A new design for the Mississippi state flag will be voted on in November 2020.

      p To be determined.
    //-   p Both the second and third national flags of the Confederate States, like the Mississippi state flag, use the battle flag in their cantons.
    //-   p Defenders of the battle flag claim it is a symbol of the south’s history and defense of liberty and states’ rights during the Civil War.
    //-   p Despite this claim, it is representative of the Confederacy’s support and defense of slavery. Since the war, the battle flag has been used as a rallying banner for white supremacists and a symbol of continued racism and violence.
