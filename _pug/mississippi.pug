  .intro
    p For 126 years, Mississippi’s flag featured the Confederate Battle flag in its canton. Despite its inclusion of the racist symbol, the people of Mississippi voted to keep this version of the flag in a referendum in 2001.
    p Following nationwide Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, the state finally removed the flag and created a commission to design a new one.
    p Voters chose The New Magnolia flag, designed by Rocky Vaughan, Sue Anna Joe, Kara Giles, and Dominique Pugh. The flag was made official November 2020 and renamed the In God We Trust flag.
